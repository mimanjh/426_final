# Introduction
Throughout the years, plenty of technology companies have emerged. Within the technology field, five companies are known for being the most prominent technological companies of America. They are known as the FAANG company. FAANG company contains Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. STEM major graduates that work within these companies are known for receiving high compensations. Our question of interest is to determine which working demographics in the STEM field yield the highest total yearly compensation.
With a given dataset that contains different companies, positions, and salary, through data cleaning and wrangling, we can use models to predict and see which FAANG company gives the best compensation. 



# Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Remove duplicates of education status (i.e. if someone had a bachelors (1) and a masters (1) then we reclassify that row that they only have a masters (1) and not bachelors (0)).
2. Remove rows with base salary as zero.
3. We noticed that there are also zero values for some 'yearsofexperience' and 'yearsatcompany' variables. In this case, we will assume that they are newly hired people and will not drop those 0 values.
4. Because there would be a correlation between the companies and the location of where the companies are based in in relation to the total yearly compensation variable, we decided to drop the location variable.
